## Rust Code Generator

The following have been added into the existing [`generators`](generators) folder to generate Rust code and to add blocks specific to Mynewt...

[`generators/rust.js`](generators/rust.js): Main interface for Rust Code Generator

[`generators/rust`](generators/rust): Rust Code Generator for various blocks

## Demo for Rust Code Generator

The Blockly demo at [`demos/code`](demos/code) has been customised to include the Rust Code Generator...

## Visual Studio Code Extension

For easier code editing, this entire repository as been wrapped into the [visual-embedded-rust](https://github.com/lupyuen/visual-embedded-rust) Visual Studio Code Extension.

This repository is installed in the `media/blockly-mynewt-rust` folder of the extension.

# Blockly [![Build Status]( https://travis-ci.org/google/blockly.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/blockly)


Google's Blockly is a web-based, visual programming editor.  Users can drag
blocks together to build programs.  All code is free and open source.

**The project page is https://developers.google.com/blockly/**

Blockly has an active [developer forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/blockly). Please drop by and say hello. Show us your prototypes early; collectively we have a lot of experience and can offer hints which will save you time.

Help us focus our development efforts by telling us [what you are doing with
Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/registration). The questionnaire only takes
a few minutes and will help us better support the Blockly community.
